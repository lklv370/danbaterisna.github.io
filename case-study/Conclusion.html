			<p> Baguio is a city located in the Cordilleras, with gold resources significant enough to form the backbone of the economic capital of the North it is known as today. The city, and the surrounding region of Benguet, have mineral deposits totalling over 40 million liquid ounces, which contributes to gold's proportion of output towards the Philippine economy, which is significant compared to other metals. Gold is extracted from ore-bearing rocks using the amalgam process, which employs mercury to separate gold from other components in the rock, and is generally thought to originally from by stellar fusion, after which it is carried to Earth. There are various risks involved in conducting mining operations in Baguio, such as exposing workers to hazardous materials, and altering the local landscape and ecosystem. Through an examination of the surrounding variables, it can be seen that mining in Baguio has the needed components for sustainable operations; however, development of legislative systems, cooperation of large and small-scale miners, and a viable development plan far past the lifespan of mining operations are needed to create an inclusive and sustainable mining industry in Baguio. </p>
